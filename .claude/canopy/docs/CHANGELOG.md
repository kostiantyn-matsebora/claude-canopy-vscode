---

## [0.9.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added

- `runtimes/claude.md` — Claude Code runtime spec: base paths (`.claude/`), native explore subagent execution, ambient rules via globs, agent and skill invocation forms
- `runtimes/copilot.md` — GitHub Copilot runtime spec: base paths (`.github/`), inline sequential file-reading fallback when native subagent is unavailable, `copilot-instructions.md` rules wiring, explicit agent invocation form
- `agents/canopy/schemas/dispatch-schema.json` — output contract for the canopy agent's own intent-classification subagent; fields: `operation`, `platform` (`claude` | `copilot`), `target_skill`, `extra_context`

### Changed

- `agents/canopy.md` — restructured from free-form prose to Canopy skill format (frontmatter + `## Agent` + `## Tree` + `## Rules` + `## Response:`); `## Agent` explore subagent now classifies intent **and** detects platform; `## Tree` replaces LLM-inferred dispatch with an explicit `IF/ELSE_IF` chain over `context.operation` — deterministic routing to one of 10 ops; falls back to `ASK` when intent is ambiguous
- `docs/README.md` — added "Skills that run on Claude Code and GitHub Copilot" to Why Canopy; updated How It Works to describe platform-aware execution and self-hosting agent design; updated Under the Hood diagram with Stage 2 (detect platform + load runtime), Stage 3 (explore with native vs inline fallback), and runtime specs legend
- `docs/FRAMEWORK.md` — added Runtime Model section (interpreter model rationale, feature delta table, runtime spec file list); updated directory layout to show `runtimes/` and both schema files
- `CLAUDE.md` — updated Key Files to document `runtimes/`, `dispatch-schema.json`, and the new canopy agent structure

---

## [0.8.1] — 2026-04-16

### Changed

- `agents/canopy/ops/improve.md`, `modify.md`, `refactor-skills.md`, `convert-to-canopy.md`, `create.md`, `scaffold.md`, `convert-to-regular.md` — all confirmation-pause ops now emit a fenced `apply` block (op name, skill name, per-file change list) immediately before asking "Proceed?"; if re-invoked after the block is visible in context the agent skips analysis and applies directly, preventing plan context loss across invocations
- `agents/canopy/ops/help.md` — corrected Claude Code CLI invocation section: `/canopy` invokes a skill, not the agent; natural language requests auto-apply the agent from `.claude/agents/canopy.md`; explicit form documented as `Follow .claude/agents/canopy.md and <request>`

---

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- `agents/canopy/ops/` — per-operation procedure files extracted from `agents/canopy.md`: `create.md`, `modify.md`, `scaffold.md`, `convert-to-canopy.md`, `validate.md`, `convert-to-regular.md`, `improve.md`, `advise.md`, `refactor-skills.md`, `help.md`
- `agents/canopy/constants/` — extracted lookup tables: `category-dirs.md`, `control-flow-notation.md`, `operation-detection.md`, `operations-dispatch.md`
- `agents/canopy/verify/` — expected-state checklists for `VERIFY_EXPECTED` per operation: `create-expected.md`, `modify-expected.md`, `scaffold-expected.md`, `convert-to-canopy-expected.md`, `convert-to-regular-expected.md`, `improve-expected.md`, `refactor-skills-expected.md`
- `agents/canopy/policies/skill-structure-rules.md`, `writing-rules.md`, `op-naming-rules.md`, `subagent-rules.md`, `debug-rules.md`, `preservation-rules.md`, `category-decision-flowchart.md`, `conversion-expansion-rules.md` — `optimization-rules.md` decomposed into targeted single-concern policy files
- New operations on the `canopy` agent: `IMPROVE` (fix violations, re-categorise resources, align with framework), `ADVISE` (read-only "how to" plans), `REFACTOR_SKILLS` (extract ops/resources shared across > 2 skills to `shared/`), `HELP` (usage reference)
- `skills/canopy-help/SKILL.md` — read-only skill that emits the canopy agent help reference or a specific operation procedure

### Changed

- `agents/canopy.md` — inline operation procedures and constants replaced with `Read <category>/<file>` references; tree examples expanded with a full `release` skill illustration; `REFACTOR_SKILLS` and `HELP` added to operation detection; two new rules added (no duplicate shared ops/resources; verify references after every change)
- `agents/canopy/policies/optimization-rules.md` — now an index table pointing to the decomposed policy files
- `agents/canopy/schemas/explore-schema.json` — `existing_resources` field updated to reference new policy file names
- `docs/FRAMEWORK.md`, `CLAUDE.md` — directory layout updated to show `ops/`, `constants/`, `verify/` under `agents/canopy/`; sync-required note updated to reference `agents/canopy/policies/` instead of the single `optimization-rules.md`
- `docs/README.md` — usage table extended with IMPROVE, ADVISE, REFACTOR_SKILLS, HELP operations

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added

- `skills/canopy-debug/skill.md` — new `canopy-debug` skill; traces any Canopy skill with live phase banners and per-node tree tracking; respects Claude Code mode (plan mode simulates mutations, edit mode executes normally)
- `skills/canopy-debug/ops.md` — skill-local ops: `EMIT_PHASE_BANNER` (renders double-box phase banners), `EXECUTE_WITH_TRACE` (drives full skill execution with tracing), `TRACE_NODE` (emits stream one-liner and overwrites trace file per state change), `TRACE_EXECUTE_NODES` (iterates nodes with mode-aware branch evaluation), `WRITE_TRACE_FILE` (overwrites `.canopy-debug-trace.log` with current full-tree snapshot)
- `skills/canopy-debug/policies/debug-output.md` — debug output protocol: dual-channel output (chat stream + trace file), phase registry with ordinals and descriptions, phase banner format, node state symbol table (`→ ⟳ ✓ ◎ ⊘ ✗ ⏸ ⊙`), stream and trace file formats, mode-aware execution rules, ASK interaction protocol, EXPLORE subagent handling, END/HALTED display

### Changed

- `docs/README.md` — added "Failures you can trace to a single node" bullet to the "Why Canopy?" section; references `/canopy-debug` for live phase and per-node tracing

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-12

### Changed

- `agents/canopy-skill.md` → `agents/canopy.md` — agent renamed from `canopy-skill` to `canopy`
- `agents/canopy-skill/` → `agents/canopy/` — agent resource directory renamed to match
- `agents/canopy.md` — frontmatter `name:` updated to `canopy`; `optimization-rules.md` glob updated to `**/canopy/policies/optimization-rules.md`
- `docs/FRAMEWORK.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/AUTHORING.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — all `canopy-skill` agent references updated to `canopy`

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- `agents/canopy-skill.md` — `canopy-skill` promoted from skill to Claude Code agent; handles six operations: CREATE (new skill from description), MODIFY (targeted edits to existing skill), SCAFFOLD (blank skeleton with all dirs), CONVERT_TO_CANOPY (flat skill → Canopy format), VALIDATE (errors, warnings, optimization report), CONVERT_TO_REGULAR (Canopy → flat skill)
- `agents/canopy-skill/templates/skill.md` and `agents/canopy-skill/templates/ops.md` — skeleton templates used by the SCAFFOLD operation
- `AUTHORING.md` — manual skill authoring reference: full anatomy walkthrough, both tree syntaxes with examples, op definition patterns, primitives table, category resource directory reference, and `skill.md` content constraints
- `setup.sh` and `setup.ps1` — agent wiring: symlink/junction each bundled agent `.md` file and its resource directory into `.claude/agents/` (mirrors existing skill symlink pattern)

### Changed

- `agents/canopy-skill/policies/optimization-rules.md` — moved from `skills/canopy-skill/policies/`; content unchanged
- `agents/canopy-skill/schemas/explore-schema.json` — moved from `skills/canopy-skill/schemas/`; content unchanged
- `README.md` — Usage section rewritten around the `canopy-skill` agent (operation table with example invocations); manual authoring content replaced with a link to `AUTHORING.md`; `## Skill Anatomy` section trimmed to structural overview only; Features bullet updated to reflect agent promotion; `AUTHORING.md` added to Directory Structure
- `FRAMEWORK.md` — added `## Framework Agents` section documenting agent format, resource subdirectory conventions, and setup wiring; directory layout updated to show `agents/` alongside `skills/`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — sync-required file list updated to reference `agents/canopy-skill/policies/optimization-rules.md`

### Removed

- `skills/canopy-skill/skill.md` and `skills/canopy-skill/ops.md` — superseded by `agents/canopy-skill.md`

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- Markdown list syntax (`*` nested lists) as an alternative to box-drawing characters for tree definitions — write trees directly under `## Tree` without a fenced code block
- `examples/` documentation split out to `claude-canopy-examples` repo; canopy repo stays submodule-clean

### Changed

- `rules/skill-resources.md` — Tree format section now documents both syntaxes with examples
- `FRAMEWORK.md` — Tree Execution Model section shows both formats side-by-side; Skill-Local ops.md section shows markdown list format as alternative for branching op definitions
- `README.md` — `## Tree` anatomy and minimal example updated to lead with markdown list syntax
- `skills/canopy-skill/policies/optimization-rules.md` — Rule 6 updated to list both formats; markdown list marked as preferred for new/simple trees

---

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- community health files for GitHub: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates, and pull request template

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-12

### Changed

- `README.md` — replaced the broken external examples link with plain repo mention, made the `## Agent` example generic instead of project-specific, and reduced duplication between `Skill Anatomy` and `Writing a Skill`

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- `setup.ps1` — create directory junctions in `.claude/skills/` for each bundled canopy skill so VS Code discovers them outside the submodule boundary
- `setup.sh` — create symlinks in `.claude/skills/` for each bundled canopy skill for the same reason on Linux/macOS

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-12

### Added

- `setup.sh` and `setup.ps1` — submodule setup scripts; create wiring files in the user's project so Claude Code can see both canopy internals and project skills
- `skills/canopy-skill/` — renamed from `optimize-skill`; bundled meta-skill for auditing and optimizing Canopy skills

### Changed

- `README.md` — added "How It Works" diagram showing full skill anatomy; added inline examples in Features; added Skill Anatomy section; rewrote Quick Start Option A (vendored via curl/tar, explicit warning against git clone) and Option B (git submodule + setup script); removed manual Submodule Wiring section
- `FRAMEWORK.md` — removed content duplicated in README (intro paragraph, submodule directory tree, Skill Anatomy); added pointer to README for setup instructions
- `rules/skill-resources.md` — updated standalone note to reference setup scripts

---
